# Inmar-Project

Used Tech Stack:  
FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, JS.  
Backend: JSP, Java.  
Server: Tomcat, Xampp.  

Implementation Details:  
Copy the GoKart folder to webapps folder present in tomcat folder.  
Import database.sql using phpMyAdmin which creates the necessary tables for the web application.  
I have created a new user to access the data from tables instead of using root user, import or use user.sql to create new user or if you want to change the username and password in Connection.java and recompile it.
